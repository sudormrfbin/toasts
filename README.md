# Toasts

Toasts is an app that shows desktop notifications from various websites like GitHub,
StackExchange, BitBucket, and the likes. It just runs in the background and shows
you a notification when there is one from sites you have enabled. Authentication to
your user account on a particular website is done through a Personal Access Token or
Oauth.

I'm still working on it, so hang tight :)

For the first release, I'm planning to support GitHub only. StackExchange, BitBucket,
Libraries.io, etc, will be supported on subsequent releases.
